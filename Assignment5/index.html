<h3>Creative Collective</h3>

    <p>One idea for a website would be a website for my Missoula based creative collective Mountain State Media. 
        It is a collective of creatives, including photographers, videographers, editors, and even a music producer.
        The tone would be friendly, like a family of creatives that want to help you grow your business or brand.
    </p>

<h3>Clothing Website</h3>

    <p>Another website isea could be a clothing website. 
        It would open with a low quality grungy video of the clotnhing immediatly grabbing the viewer's attention.
        It would be a darker tone of a streetwear brand.
    </p>

<h3>Blog</h3>

    <p>
        The third website could be a blog.
        I could just talk about life and have a wholesome learning tone.
        Just a nice learning website.
    </p>
