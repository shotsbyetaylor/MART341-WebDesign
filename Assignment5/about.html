<h1>Why I chose these websites.</h1>

<br />

<h3>Creative Collective</h3>

    <p>
        It is a collective of creatives, including photographers, videographers, editors, and even a music producer.
        It would be good for my career.

<h3>Clothing Website</h3>

    <p>
        Another website isea could be a clothing website. 
        I have always wanted to sell clothes and I have some good ideas.

    <p>
        The third website could be a blog.
