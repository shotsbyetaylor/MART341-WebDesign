I chose to create the wensite for my creative collective Mountain State Media. It seems like the most useful for real life. It will be professional yet a little playful, as most clients are high school students or parents.

I used what I learned this week to make the overview of my website, which I will continue to expand on in weeks to come. I am not settled on the colors yet, but having them not be black and whtie is definelty more captivating to the viewer.

It works well! I thought it would, and I'm excited to keep working on it.

I like the margins, it's nice to give some breathing room around the edges.

I struggled a little bit just remembering the commands for CSS, but just continued checking the course website for help.
