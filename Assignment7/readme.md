Hi professor!

First off I just want to say sorry for the late work, had the busiest work weekend of my life and I'm still catching up on homework.

I am pretty proud of the table I made. It is a semi-functional calendar for setting dates for shoots for my media company. I am also a fan of how I styled it. I think it looks clean without the colors being to tacky.
